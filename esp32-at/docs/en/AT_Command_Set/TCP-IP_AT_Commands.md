Response:

    OK
Parameters:

- **\<enable>**:
    - 1: the SNTP server is configured.
    - 0: the SNTP server is not configured.
- **\<timezone>**: Time zones support two formats.
    - The first format range is [-12,14].  
    It marks most of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours ([UTC−12:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%E2%88%9212:00) to [UTC+14:00](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC%2B14:00)).
    - The second format is `UTC offset`.  
    The `UTC offset` specifies the time value you must add to the UTC time to get a local time value. It has syntax like `[+|-]hh[mm]`. This is negative if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and positive if it is east. The hour(hh) must be between -12 and 14, and the minute(mm) between 0 and 59. For example, set `timezone` to `1245`, it marks the local time of New Zealand (Chatham Islands) which in `UTC+12:45`, more UTC offset details see as [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#List_of_UTC_offsets).
- **\<SNTP server1>**: the first SNTP server.
- **\<SNTP server2>**: the second SNTP server.
- **\<SNTP server3>**: the third SNTP server.

    // enable sntp server, set timezone to New York of the United States(UTC−05:00)
    AT+CIPSNTPCFG=1,-5,"0.pool.ntp.org","time.google.com"
    or
    AT+CIPSNTPCFG=1,-500,"0.pool.ntp.org","time.google.com"

    // enable sntp server, set timezone to New Zealand(Chatham Islands, UTC+12:45)

<a name="cmd-CIPRECVMODE"></a>
### [AT+CIPRECVMODE](#TCPIP-AT)—Set Socket Receive Mode
Query Command:

    AT+CIPRECVMODE?
    Function: to query socket receive mode.
Response:

    +CIPRECVMODE:<mode>
    OK
Set Command:

    AT+CIPRECVMODE=<mode>
Response:

    OK

Parameters:
- **\<mode>**: the receive mode of socket data is active mode by default.
    - 0: active mode - ESP-AT will send all the received socket data instantly to host MCU through UART with header “+IPD".
    - 1: passive mode - ESP-AT will keep the received socket data in an internal buffer (default is 5744 bytes), and wait for host MCU to read the data. If the buffer is full, the socket transmission will be blocked.

Example:

    AT+CIPRECVMODE=1   

***Notes:***

* The configuration is for TCP and SSL transmission only, and can not be used on WiFi-UART passthrough mode. If it is a UDP transmission in passive mode，data will be missed when buffer full.

* If the passive mode is enabled, when ESP-AT receives socket data, it will prompt the following message in different scenarios: 
    - for multiple connection mode (AT+CIPMUX=1), the message is: `+IPD,<link ID>,<len>`
    - for single connection mode (AT+CIPMUX=0), the message is: `+IPD,<len>`
    - `<len>` is the total length of socket data in buffer
    - User should read data by command `AT+CIPRECVDATA` once there is a `+IPD` reported. Otherwise, the next `+IPD` will not be reported to the host MCU, until the previous `+IPD` be read by command `AT+CIPRECVDATA`.
    - In a case of disconnection, the buffered socket data will still be there and can be read by MCU until you send `AT+CIPCLOSE`. Specially, if `+IPD` has been reported, the message `CLOSED` of this connection will never come until you send `AT+CIPCLOSE` or read all data by command `AT+CIPRECVDATA`.

    AT+CIPRECVDATA=<link_id>,<len>
Response:

    +CIPRECVDATA:<actual_len>,<data>
    OK

or

    +CIPRECVDATA:<actual_len>,<remote IP>,<remote port>,<data>
    OK

Parameters:

- **\<link_id>**: connection ID in multiple connection mode.
- **\<len>**: the max value is up to 0x7fffffff, if the actual length of the received data is less than `len`, the actual length will be returned.
- **\<actual_len>**: length of the data you actually get
- **\<data>**: the data you get
- **\[\<remote IP>]**: remote IP string, enabled by command `AT+CIPDINFO=1`.
- **\[\<remote port>]**: remote port, enabled by command `AT+CIPDINFO=1`.

Example:

    AT+CIPRECVMODE=1
    For example, if host MCU gets a message of receiving 100 bytes data in connection with No.0, the message will be as following: +IPD,0,100
    then you can read those 100 bytes by using the command below
    AT+CIPRECVDATA=0,100
