## ESP32 Series

ESP32 AT uses two UART port, UART0 is to download firmware and print background logs when running, UART1 is to send AT commands and receive AT responses. Different ESP32 modules use different GPIOs as UART1, so please pay attention to the hardware connection, and download the corresponding AT firmware to your specific ESP32 module. 

Follow the guide [Details of establishing serial connection](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html), to establish your serial connection.
